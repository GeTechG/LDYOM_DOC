## Mission building
In this text lesson we will try to make the mission as in [video](#video) above.
First we need to create the mission package and the mission itself. To do it, turn on **Main menu** *(pressing U)* and go to **Mission packs**. Press **Create** a new package will appear, then press **Create** again but already in **Missions** window. You can rename it if you like.

??? "How to rename?"
    * To change the package, highlight the package in the window **Mission packs** and click **Rename**. Enter your package name in the input field and click **Close**.
    * To rename a mission, exit the window **Mission packs** *(press U)*, go to **Mission settings**. In the **Mission name** field, type in your mission name. Then go back to **Mission packs** and in the window **Missions** select the mission and press **Save**.

![screen1](../../img\Screenshot_1.jpg)

## Mission setting

Pick a place where the mission will begin. Put a mark on the map, and we can use the function LDYOM, teleport to the mark. To do this, go to **Main menu** - **Tools** and select **Teleport to marker**.

![screen3](../../img\Screenshot_3.jpg)

Let's move on to mission settings. **Main menu** - **Mission settings**. Let's change the time of day at the beginning of the mission, press **Time in the mission**. I'll set the time to 7:00, also **Maximum wanted** set it to 0 so the police don't touch us.

![screen4](../../img\Screenshot_4.jpg)

Let's put the player's spawn. To do this, press **Player** in the same window. 1. Click on the icon **Player coordinates** (the current coordinates are set) 2. Click on the clothing icon, and select a skin.

![screen5](../../img\Screenshot_5.jpg)

## Most of the creation
Let's start, as in DYOM, by creating an actor.

!!! info
    Anyway, where to start is not so important as LDYOM is non-linear. The only important thing is the order of the targets, they work linearly, but they can also be regrouped if necessary.

**Main menu** - **Actors** - **Add**. We're alienating the actor a little further, because we'll add the action to walk, a little later. I picked 21 models. The rest can be left as is.

![screen6](../../img\Screenshot_6.jpg)

To make the conditions more clear, we will first create a goal, and then create it, but in general it makes no difference.
**Main menu** - **Targets** - **Add**, select **Environment** and **Cutscene** - **Create**. Move slider **Follow** to position **Actor** and select in the list of newly created actor. Time will be set to 3 seconds.

![screen7](../../img\Screenshot_7.jpg)

Press **Edit manually** and set the camera to the starting position approximately on the actor.

![screen8](../../img\Screenshot_8.jpg)

Now we have to get acquainted with such thing as **Node Editor**.

!!! info
    Node editor added from Beta 0.7.0

We'll use it to make the actor walk. Let's start, let's open it, **Main menu** - **Node Editor**, we won't go into interface details, I can release a separate tutorial on this later. Click on the middle part of the RMB editor and the list of nodes will appear, they are divided into groups. We are interested in the group **Mission**, in it we choose the node **Start target**.

![screen9](../../img\Screenshot_9.jpg)

A node appears, in the drop-down list **Target** select a target with cutscene. Next, press RMB again, and this time we enter the group **Actor** and select the node **Follow the path**.

![screen10](../../img\Screenshot_10.jpg)

Now we need to connect the nodes together to form a chain. In the nodes next to the values, you can see circles (connectors), which are the points at which the nodes connect to each other. On the left are responsible for the incoming and on the right are responsible for the outgoing. Quick tour through the colors.

| Color               | Value                                                            |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| :white_circle:      | Stores nothing in yourself, is the wire between the nodes.       |
| :blue_circle:       | Stores a numeric value, sends its value forward    .             |
| :red_circle:        | Stores a logical value, sends its value forward.                 |
| ðŸŸ¢                   | Stores a string, sends it forward.                               |

For now, it's enough that the white connector is the conductor we need. Point your mouse at any white connector (it doesn't matter if it's an input or output connector) and, while holding down your mouse, drag it to another connector and let go. A circuit must be formed between the nodes. It is now connected.

!!! info
    If you want to disconnect the nodes, press RMB on the incoming connector, and the circuit will be broken. 

![screen11](../../img\Screenshot_11.jpg)

Note the second node. Choose our actor to go from the drop-down list **Actor**. Then choose **Movement type** - **Walking**, **Route type** leave it as default. 

![screen12](../../img\Screenshot_12.jpg)

Now press **Record path**, set the actor's path, exit.

![screen13](../../img\Screenshot_13.jpg)

While we are closing the editor and creating the target for cutscene again, but this time as unusual, go to **Targets** select the previous cutscene and press **Duplicate**. The letter "c" will be added automatically. You do not need to touch, or you can rename it.

![screen14](../../img\Screenshot_14.jpg)

Duplicated to conveniently copy the camera position. Put **Follow** on **No**. This time we're going to make a smooth camera, for that we're going to turn on **Move camera**. Set the time for 5 seconds, and fill in the field **Text**.

*~b~Terry~w~: Hey, there's a hidden case downtown with $30000 inside.*

![screen15](../../img\Screenshot_15.jpg)

Point the camera at the player.

![screen16](../../img\Screenshot_16.jpg)

Let's create another flyover cutscene, create a "pacifier" for that. **Main menu** - **Targets** - **Add** - **Environment** and **Cutscene** - **Create**. We set the time to 0 and put the camera at the starting position.

![screen17](../../img\Screenshot_17.jpg)

We'll duplicate the target again. Let's turn on **Move camera**, set it to 5 seconds, and fill in the **Text** field.

*~b~Terry~w~: Bring it to me, and we'll split it in half. Okay?*

![screen18](../../img\Screenshot_18.jpg)

Put the camera in position.

![screen19](../../img\Screenshot_19.jpg)

Now let's do a player animation. **Main menu** - **Targets** - **Add** - **Player** and **Player animation** - **Create**. Now you need to find the desired one in the pile of animations, to do it, select **Pack** and **Animation**, press **Preview**. To make your search easier, select **Pack** - **COP_AMBIENT** and **Animation** - **Coplook_thing**. The rest is left as default.

![screen20](../../img\Screenshot_20.jpg)

We're creating a cutscene. **Main menu** - **Targets** - **Add** - **Environment** and **Cutscene** - **Create**. Set 3 seconds, and write **Text** - *Dave: Of course I'll do it!*

![screen21](../../img\Screenshot_21.jpg)

Put the camera in position.

![screen22](../../img\Screenshot_22.jpg)

We're creating a target to collect the pickup. **Main menu** - **Targets** - **Add** - **Pickup** - **Create**. You need a pickup for this purpose, but we've already created a target, here's an example of non-linearity.

!!! warning
    But you cannot launch a mission when something is not specified, because it will cause a script error.

Let's make the same pickup truck. **Main menu** - **Pickups** - **Add**. Appears the pickup, put it in position, select **Weapons** - **Tec-9**, ** Appears on** select our target with the pickup. **We're going to put 150 ammo. We'll leave the rest to default.

![screen23](../../img\Screenshot_23.jpg)

We return to the target, and we see that the first pickup has automatically got out. **Marker color** set **Green**, time set 5 seconds, in the field **Text** - *Pick your ~g~weapon~w~.*

![screen24](../../img\Screenshot_24.jpg)

Also by analogy, we'll add another pickup with a knife.

![screen25](../../img\Screenshot_25.jpg)

And a pickup with armor. You need to change the **Type** to **Armor**.

![screen26](../../img\Screenshot_26.jpg)

Let's make the actor go away. Let's go back to **Node editor**, and create the node **Start target** and point **Target** at the target with the pickup.

![screen27](../../img\Screenshot_27.jpg)

In the same way, we create a node **Follow the path**, connect, specify a path.

![screen28](../../img\Screenshot_28.jpg)

We get out of the editor, and we go into the actor. Pointing **Disappearance after** to the last target.

![screen29](../../img\Screenshot_29.jpg)

Let's make a bike. **Main menu** - **Vehicles** - **Add**. **Vehicle selection** select PCJ-600 *(id461)*. Go to **Characteristics** and change the color to suit your taste. We put **Health** 2500. We edit manually.

![screen30](../../img\Screenshot_30.jpg)

Let's create a vehicle target. **Main menu** - **Targets** - **Add** - **Get in the vehicle** - **Create**. In **Vehicle** we choose our bike. **Marker color** put **Blue**, in the field **Text** - *Sit on ~b~ motorcycle~w~.*

![screen31](../../img\Screenshot_31.jpg)

Teleport to the mission location.

![screen32](../../img\Screenshot_32.jpg)

We'll close the aisle. To do this, let's create the object(s). **Main menu** - **Objects** - **Add**. You can point objects at guesses, but there are more than 1000 of them, so I will use the site below.

!!! note
    https://dev.prineside.com/ru/gtasa_samp_model_id/s

In field **Model** write 2990 and **Apply**. The fence appears. **Appearance on** put it on the last target. Set it to block the path, if it's not enough, create another object.

![screen33](../../img\Screenshot_33.jpg)

We'll create two hiding places with pickups. For this purpose, we create a box object. **Main menu** - **Objects** - **Add**. **Model** - 1224, **Appearance on** is the last target. Exactly the same way we do the second one.

![screen34](../../img\Screenshot_34.jpg)

Now the pickups. First **Type** - **Health**, second **Type** - **Weapons**, Desert Eagle weapons, **Ammo** - 5. **Appearance on** put both on last target. Let's make sure they can't be seen from behind the boxes.

![screen35](../../img\Screenshot_35.jpg)

Let's make a car. **Main menu** - **Vehicles** - **Add**. Car - Sabre (475), let's lock the car, put **Appearance on** - last target. 

![screen36](../../img\Screenshot_36.jpg)

Let's make enemies, we need to set up group relationships for that. Let's go to **Main menu** - **Group relationship**. Choose any group but 1, by default all actors from 1 group, it is better to take 2 or more. Open it, change the slider in front of **Player** to **Hate**.

![screen37](../../img\Screenshot_37.jpg)

Now let's make an enemy. **Command menu** - **Actors** - **Add**. **Model** - 103, go to **Characteristics**, **Weapon** - Desert Eagle, **Ammo** - 9999, **Health** - 250, **Accuracy** - 75, **Headshot** - turn it off, **Appearance on** - last target, **Group** - the group you made the enemy.

![screen38](../../img\Screenshot_38.jpg)

To add an animation to the enemy, go to **Node editor**. Create the node **Start target** select the last target, and create the node **Actor** - **Play the actor's animation** connect them. Choose our enemy in **Actor**, in **Animation** - IDLE_chat, turn on **Looped**.

![screen39](../../img\Screenshot_39.jpg)

Let's create another actor. **Model** - 102, **Weapon** - Uzi, **Ammo** - 9999, **Acuracy** - 50, **Headshot** - switch it off, **Health** - 250, **Group** - enemies, **Appearance on** - last target.

![screen40](../../img\Screenshot_40.jpg)

We're making more enemies.

![screen41](../../img\Screenshot_41.jpg)

Let's add a scene with a dead body. Let's add a scene with a object cop. **Model** - 3092. **Appearance on** - last target.

![screen42](../../img\Screenshot_42.jpg)

We'll add an enemy next to it. **Model** - 104. **Health** - 500. **Weapon** - Knife. **Headshot** - switch it off. **Group** - enemies. **Appearance on** - last target.

![screen43](../../img\Screenshot_43.jpg)

Let's add an animation to the actor, go to **Node editor**. Create the node **Actor** - **Play the actor's animation** connect it to the node from the existing target or lead to the previous node of the animation. Choose our enemy in **Actor**, in **Pack** - BOMBER, **Animation** - BOM_PLANT_LOOP, turn on **Looped**.

!!! info
    It is recommended not to create a heap of similar nodes, it is better to chain them together, except if the nodes are too far apart.

![screen44](../../img\Screenshot_44.jpg)

Let's create another enemy at the entrance. **Model** - 104, **Weapon** - Desert Eagle, **Accuracy** - 100, **Health** - 250, **Headshot** - switch off, **Appearance on** - last target.

![screen45](../../img\Screenshot_45.jpg)

Also add animation to the actor, go to **Node editor**. Create the node **Actor** - **Play the actor's animation** connect it to the node with the existing target or lead to the previous node of the animation. Choose in **Actor** our enemy, in **Pack** - MISC **Animation** - PLYRLEAN_LOOP, turn on **Looped**.

![screen46](../../img\Screenshot_46.jpg)

We're creating a target checkpoint. **Main menu** - **Targets** - **Add** - **Checkpoint** - **Create**. Increase the radius, **Marker color** - **Yellow**, **Text** - **Drive to ~y~downtown~w~.*

![screen47](../../img\Screenshot_47.jpg)

Let's create a flyover cutscene. **Main menu** - **Targets** - **Add** - **Environment** and **Cutscene** - **Create**. We'll make a smooth camera, for that we turn on **Camera motion**. We set the time to 3 seconds. We'll put it in position.

![screen48](../../img\Screenshot_48.jpg)

We're creating another flyover cutscene.

![screen49](../../img\Screenshot_49.jpg)

Now it's cutscene with a dead body. It's time for two seconds.

![screen50](../../img\Screenshot_50.jpg)

Duplicate the last cutscene. We're changing the time by three seconds.

![screen52](../../img\Screenshot_52.jpg)

Let's create particles for the corpse. **Main menu** - **Particles** - **Add**. **Particle** - blood_heli, **Appearance on** - last target.

![screen51](../../img\Screenshot_51.jpg)

We're creating a target to kill the actor. **Main menu** - **Targets** - **Add** - **Hit/kill actor** - **Create**. To **Actor** select the enemy from the corpse, mark **Kill everyone in the group?**, **Target text** - *Kill everyone ~r~ Enemies~w~.*

![screen53](../../img\Screenshot_53.jpg)

We create a target for the pickup. **Main menu** - **Targets** - **Add** - **Pickup** - **Create**. Now let's create a pickup for the target. **Main menu** - **Pickups** - **Add**. **Type** - **Other**, **Model** - 1210, **Appearance on** - target pickup.

![screen54](../../img\Screenshot_54.jpg)

Return to target. In **Pickup** select the newly created pickup, in **Text** - *Pickup ~g~case~w~.*

![screen55](../../img\Screenshot_55.jpg)

We add money to the player. **Main menu** - **Targets** - **Add** - **Player** - **Add money**. **Add** - 30000

![screen56](../../img\Screenshot_56.jpg)

Let's go back.

![screen3](../../img\Screenshot_3.jpg)

Let's create an actor. **Main menu** - **Actors** - **Add**. **Model** - 21. Let's put **Must we survive?**, **Appearance on** is the last target.

![screen57](../../img\Screenshot_57.jpg)

We're making a checkpoint. **Text** - *Come back ~y~home~w~ and meet ~b~Terry~w~.*, **Time** put 5 seconds.

![screen58](../../img\Screenshot_58.jpg)

We're creating a cutscene. **Time** 5 seconds, **Text** - **b~Terry~w~: Way to go, man, here's your cut!**

![screen59](../../img\Screenshot_59.jpg)

Now set Terry's animation, go to **Node editor**. Create the node **Start target** select the last cutscene, and create the node **Actor** - **Play the actor's animation** connect them. Choose in **Actor** our Terry, in **Animation** - IDLE_chat, turn on **Looped**.

![screen60](../../img\Screenshot_60.jpg)

We take half the money. **Main menu** - **Targets** - **Add** - **Player** - **Add money**. **Add** and enter -15000.

![screen61](../../img\Screenshot_61.jpg)

We're creating a timeout. **Main menu** - **Targets** - **Add** - **Environment** - **Timeout** - **Create**. We leave it as default.

![screen62](../../img\Screenshot_62.jpg)

## End
The whole mission is ready, we keep the mission and we can check it out.

![screen63](../../img\Screenshot_63.jpg)

You should have a mission in the end. If you have any difficulties or misunderstandings you can download my [save (Beta 0.7.0)](../files\Simple_mission.zip).
